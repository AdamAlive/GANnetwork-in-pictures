# GANnetwork-in-pictures
## Introduction

 - This is the GANnetwork with improved with WGAN structure.

 - I write the GAN both by fully connected network and convolution network.

 - Here is the hyperparameter:

 - In `` GAN_fc.py `` it's the fully connected network, which shows the end like this (I use the coins' pictures and the animation figure as trainning dataset):

 and the coins' picture that made by fully connected GAN is

  - But in convolution network GAN `` GAN_cnn.py ``, I think I haven't make it for now (2017.10.10), for the generate picture is very ... convolution.

## How to use

 - Put all datasets in to a folder and change the ``input_data`` content to your dataset folder, After it trained, you can turn off To_Train button and run it again it will create pictures generated by the generator.

 - I have uploaded 3 trained model to the folder `` 训练完成的模型 ``, whose name represent the dataset's type I trained. 
 For example, `` 立绘脸斜_256_256 `` means the type is animation figure, and its hyperparameter `` n_hidden `` and `` n_noise `` should be 255, 255. Unzip it and put it in the model_dir which in the code's hyperparameter named `` output_path ``, then you can get the picture!
