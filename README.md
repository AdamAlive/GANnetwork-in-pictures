# GANnetwork-in-pictures
## This is the GANnetwork with improved with WGAN structure.

I write the GAN both by fully connected network and convolution network.

Here is the hyperparameter:

 - In `` GAN_fc.py `` it's the fully connected network, which shows the end like this (I use the coins' pictures and the animation figure as trainning dataset):

 and the coins' picture that made by fully connected GAN is

  - But in convolution network GAN `` GAN_cnn.py ``, I think I haven't make it for now (2017.10.10), for the generate picture is very ... convolution.
